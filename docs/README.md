# Video Tutorial
These are 5 tutorial videos that show how SEEGA works.

The first video is the prerequisite video that help you to set up 3DSlicer with the right extensions and configuration for the other modules to work fine

The second video is about the first module called **Contact Position Estimator**, where it will generate an object called vtkMRMLMarkupsFiducialNode with the name recon

The third video is called **Brain Zone Detector** that from the recon file we got from the first module, it is used to generate more data and display the output in the description of each element of recon

The fourth video is the **GMPIComputation** and it works the same as the second module: generate an output and display it in the description of each element of recon

The last video is the **Finalizer** that has numerous tools to finalize your output such as: changing the visual output of your fiducial node, save your output in JSON and more
